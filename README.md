<p align="center">there's a glowing earth...there are stars...there are clouds vibing 20% faster...and everything spins.</p>

## ok but why is this kinda cute 🤍

a tiny 3D planet that floats in space  
spins gently  
glows at the edges like it has feelings  
paints the night side with city light  
and wears fast-moving clouds like a dramatic scarf

made using **three.js**, patience I didn’t know I had, and shader tears 🎀

##  little features🫶🏻

- 🎨 **three different textures**  
  - one for land & water  
  - one for *city lights at night*  
  - one for cloudy swirl drama

- **custom fresnel shader**  🌈   
  so the earth glows softly at the edges like it's blushing

- **space isn’t empty? okii**  🌌  
  generated with `BufferGeometry` and love. 5000+ stars.

- **rotating cloud layer**  ☁️  
  moves faster than the earth because it can

- **dark side, but make it city-core**  ✨  
  yes the dark side lights up. because cities.
